            This is my very first web page. I have not had much experience doing this type of work and I do not consider myself someone very creative when it comes to front end
            design. However, I will do my best! I enjoy a lot of the backend of websites and am looking forward to learning more.

            Outside of school I work at a small IT company that works mostly with local businesses in the West Suburbs. I love playing video games when I have time. As you can see from the picture above
            I do enjoy Final Fantasy, but mostly the old school PS1 era and earlier. I love being back in school finishing up as it has been way to long since I last attended. This will be my first degree.
