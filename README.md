There is a huge difference between creating your own grid and using bootstrap. For someone like myself who is not very good at creating good looking websites from scratch, templates are amazing! I mean...just look at the difference between my index and author pages! Using templates is my preferred method. 

However, making my own grid system is the way to start. It gave me a better understanding of how it works overall and allowed me to take that knowledge into the bootstrap templates. One of the areas I struggled with (and I am still struggling) is how to properly organize the code. Looking at mine it involves more sections and main and less uses of div. Looking at the template for bootstrap includes a lot more div. I need to get a better basic understanding of how to properly lay these out as I move forward. It is the one area I am the most unsure.

Another area that was a little strange when working with templates and knowing the .css behind it. I was unable to locate the source code for jumbotron.css. What is the best practice for editing the colors yourself? How do I know how <h1> vs <h2> is formatted and how can I change them? I located the .scss file in the source code, but it was lacking in alot of these options.

I guess overall coming out of this I have a lot of questions still. Which is a good thing!
